1. sort the array starting from the smallest to biggest number
1. remove duplicates from array
1. remove the first number of the array and spit the rest of the numbers into 2 pairs
1. do that for every number and list the possible combinations
1. assign row number for each possibility 
1. write function to get the sum of each pair split them in "set 1 & 2"
1. draw game board that displays possible combinations
1. event handler to select a combination that user wants
1. create score card
scorecard: create an array of 4 columns.
    - Column A to consist array of score
    - Column B to consist array of possible sum of each pair
    - Column C to contain array 
1. set function to check if the sum of pairs is equals to the combination that player has selected
